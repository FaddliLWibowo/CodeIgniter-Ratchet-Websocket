# CodeIgniter-Ratchet-Websocket
This library contains the demo of commenting/posting realtime using CodeIgniter+AngularJS+Ratchet PHP Websocket

There is no rocket science I have done to achieve this.
As you know the CodeIgniter Directory Structure

There is a folder called
CI-
  -application
            -third_party
                -Realtime (Ratchet PHP Websocket Library)
                
I put my code here and just call that code using Javascript websocket.

How to use :
1) Download the code.
2) You got a database script with name "realtime.sql", just import that script into your database named "realtime" (You may use your name but you have to change database name in CodeIgniter's database.php also.
